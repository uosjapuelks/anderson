#### Real-Time Operating System Project: Self Driving Remote Control Car

An ESP32 Wi-Fi Microcontroller is pre-programmed to connect to a hotspot. An app can then be used to establish connection with the robot and start giving intrsuctions to it.

Keil uVision5 was used along with languages C and C++ to program the robot. It uses KL25Z Freedom board integrated with an ARM microcontroller with Real Time Operating Systems along with interrupts to function. 

An ultrasonic sensor is mounted at the front of the robot for sensing obstacles.
